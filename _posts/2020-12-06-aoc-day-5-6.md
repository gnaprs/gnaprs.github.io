# Day 5
<a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/5"><b>Binary Boarding</b></a>

We're finally in!!! Now to just lie down and sleep off the rest of the flight. Jk, it's AoC so we have more problems to solve. Turns out our little code from before is **too efficient**, and we have to solve our own problems. 

*You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding pass! You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.*

> Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people. A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where `F` means "front", `B` means "back", `L` means "left", and `R` means "right". The first 7 characters will either be `F` or `B`; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in. Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in, and so on until you're left with exactly one row.

Yeah, that was a long read. But a simpler way to analyze this would be to take a hint from the title of the problem - **binary** boarding. Instead of dealing with the top half and back half, we just need to understand that the sequence of 7 `F`/`B` characters and 3 `L`/`R` characters are simply binary representation of a number from 0-127 and 0-7! And as it turns out, computers are reaaally good at reading binary. (Thanks computers!) 

So, what are binary numbers? A binary number is made up of only 0s and 1s. Counting using binary numbers is similar to decimal (that we're so familiar with), but instead of using base 10 we're in base 2! We add 1 to the right most digit, and everytime we "go over" 1, we add 1 to the next binary place (similar to adding to the next deimal place every time we "go over" 10 in demical base). Using such a system, we can represent decimal numbers in their binary forms.

| Decimal | 0 | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   | 8    | 9    | 10   | 11   | 12   | 13   | 14   | 15   |
|---------|---|---|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Binary  | 0 | 1 | 10 | 11 | 100 | 101 | 110 | 111 | 1000 | 1001 | 1010 | 1011 | 1100 | 1101 | 1110 | 1111 |
{: rules="groups"}

For example, we can parse an input of `FBFBFBFRRR` into `0101010111`. We split these up into the row number (first 7 digits, `0101010`) and column number(last 3 digits, `111`). In binary representation, this is a row `42` and column `7`.  

Now that we have our strategy planned out, let's head straight into it! First, we read in our input and parse the strings into their binary representation:

```python
import pandas as pd 

seats_bin = []
# import data
with open("input.txt", 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        line=line.split('\n')[0]

        # recognize that the format of the string is binary in the format: row = [:7], col = [7:]
        current_seat = ""
        for i in line:
            current_seat+={'F': '0','B': '1', 'L': '0', 'R': '1'}.get(i)
        seats_bin.append(current_seat)
```

## Part 1
<center>Tl;dr Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column; find the greatest seat ID</center>
{: .notice}

Alrighty - we just pop in our code for converting from binary to decimal, and then apply the given formula to get our seat ID.

```python
seats_id = []

for i in seats_bin:
    # converting from binary to row and column no.
    row = int(i[:7],2)
    col = int(i[7:],2)

    # seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column
    seats_id.append(row*8+col)
    
print('Ans:', max(seats_id))
```

    Ans: 953

Ans: `975`

## Part 2
*Ding! The "fasten seat belt" signs have turned on. Time to find your seat.* 
<center>We need to find our seat quick! We're the only missing number that's right after someone.</center>
{: .notice}

Since we have the whole list of seat IDs, we simply need to find the seat number that is missing (and isn't the first OR the last seat!).

```python
# sort all seats in numerical order
seats_id.sort()

for i, seat_id in enumerate(seats_id):
    # explicitly skip first seat
    if seat_id + 1 != seats_id[i + 1]:
        # my seat is the empty seat behind someone elses'!
        print('Ans:', seat_id + 1)
        break
```

    Ans: 615
    

Ans: `615`
