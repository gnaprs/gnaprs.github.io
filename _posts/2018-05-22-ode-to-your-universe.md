This year, the rivers flood – and yet our flowers <br>
will not reveal rivers. You said a man <br>
who floods his skin with fists stands unabated.<br>
You built houses of cards and called them towers.<br>
I found you in my dreams, but without color;<br>
Conversed with fragments of your eyes, afraid;<br>
Asked were you happy? But it was a charade.<br>
Grandpa, you lied as you ticked down the hours.<br>
I buried the whites of our piano with your teeth.<br>
I grasped the ends of memories that you weaved.<br>
I freed the hands of your grandson with your wreath.<br>
A closing anecdote, gaping sorry’s;<br>
If I turned to blink twice before you leave<br>
Would you build me a universe where I can breathe?<br>
