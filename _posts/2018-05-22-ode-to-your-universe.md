This year, the rivers flood – and yet our flowers\s\s
will not reveal rivers. You said a man\s\s
who floods his skin with fists stands unabated.\s\s
You built houses of cards and called them towers.\s\s
I found you in my dreams, but without color;\s\s
Conversed with fragments of your eyes, afraid;\s\s
Asked were you happy? But it was a charade.\s\s
Grandpa, you lied as you ticked down the hours.\s\s
I buried the whites of our piano with your teeth.\s\s
I grasped the ends of memories that you weaved.\s\s
I freed the hands of your grandson with your wreath.\s\s
A closing anecdote, gaping sorry’s;\s\s
If I turned to blink twice before you leave\s\s
Would you build me a universe where I can breathe?\s\s
